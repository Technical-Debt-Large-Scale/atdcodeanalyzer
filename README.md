# atdcodeanalyzer
Initial Prototype of the ATDCodeAnalyzer Method and Tool

[Proposed Approach](https://github.com/Technical-Debt-Large-Scale/atdcodeanalyzer/blob/main/docs/diagrams/SummaryofSysRepoAnalysis.png)

[Steps of Approach](https://github.com/Technical-Debt-Large-Scale/atdcodeanalyzer/blob/main/docs/diagrams/AnalysisCassandraRepositoryFlow.png)

We saved all commits and all modified files using the [Pydriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller) tool.

We used the [Arcan](https://essere.disco.unimib.it/wiki/arcan/#:~:text=Arcan%20is%20a%20Java%20software,are%20less%20stable%20than%20itself.) [1] tool and [Designite](https://www.designite-tools.com/) to extract Architectural Smells [2] and Design Smells [3], respectively. 

We loaded these datasets and performed an exploratory data analysis, using various Python libraries and Data Science techniques to identify patterns that could characterize ATD in source code repositories.

We calculated the following metrics to aid our analysis: *cyclomatic complexity*, *file occurrence in commits*, and *accumulated modified LOCs* over time to analyze the source code's behavior related to the maintenance effort. Besides, we used the following Archictural Smells to select files that can indicate architectural issues: *cyclic dependency* and *hub-like dependency*.
